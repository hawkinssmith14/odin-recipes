    <h1>Chicken Fajitas!</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
    <p>Sizzling hot and bursting with flavor, chicken fajitas are a Tex-Mex favorite that bring together tender strips of marinated chicken, colorful bell peppers, and onions, all seared to perfection in a hot skillet. Seasoned with a bold blend of smoky cumin, zesty lime, and a touch of chili, each bite delivers the perfect balance of spice and freshness. Wrapped in warm flour tortillas and topped with creamy guacamole, tangy sour cream, and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro, these fajitas make for a mouthwatering, crowd-pleasing meal. Whether served family-style or customized with your favorite toppings, chicken fajitas are a guaranteed hit every time! ðŸŒ®ðŸ”¥</p>
